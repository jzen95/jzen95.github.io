    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

Most days I work on corporate governance, executive turnover, and how machine learning can help make sense of messy financial data. Coffee helps; so does a good debugger.\nI am currently on the job hunt and happily between roles.\nMy work sits at the intersection of executive turnover, corporate governance, and machine learning in finance. I enjoy building models that explain CEO turnover risk, studying how governance shapes firm performance, and exploring asset pricing questions when the data gets messy.\nI completed my PhD in Finance at the University of Auckland (2025), after a M.MS in Finance (First Class Honors) at the University of Waikato (2021). Along the way I also picked up a PgCert in Computing from ANU (2019) and a B.BA in Finance from Waikato (2018).\nOn the research side, I have been an affiliated doctoral researcher at Vlerick Business School (2025) and a research assistant at the University of Auckland (2024-2025). On the teaching side, I have worked as a graduate teaching assistant and programming consultant (2022-2025), supporting analytics labs and capstone projects.\nCoding-wise, I am most at home in Python and R, and I also use SQL, Stata, and a bit of Java. For dashboards and reporting, I reach for Power BI and Tableau, and I still enjoy a good LaTeX draft when it is time to make things look serious.\nI also spent time in industry as a finance project analyst at Oxford Finance (2025), where I reviewed loan closures, recalculated settlement interest, and supported remediation reporting.\nIf you are curious about what I write, please check out my research work for publications, working papers, and projects in progress."
