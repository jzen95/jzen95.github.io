:::{#hero-heading}

Welcome! I'm Juebin Zeng, a recent PhD graduate in Finance from the University of Auckland. I am currently seeking academic and industry positions in finance.

My research focuses on **corporate governance**, **executive turnover**, and **financial machine learning**. I am particularly interested in applying advanced machine learning techniques to understand corporate decision-making and predict executive turnover outcomes.

For more details about my background and experience, please visit my [About](about.qmd) page.
