## A Quick Hello

![](/files/images/snowman.jpg){.float-right width="250" style="margin:4px 0 12px 12px; border-radius:8px;"}

I am Juebin (Jay) Zeng. I do finance research, teach a bit, and spend an unreasonable amount of time convincing machines to behave. Most days I work on corporate governance, executive turnover, and how machine learning can help make sense of messy financial data. Coffee helps; so does a good debugger.

I am currently on the job hunt and happily between roles.

My work sits at the intersection of executive turnover, corporate governance, and machine learning in finance. I enjoy building models that explain CEO turnover risk, studying how governance shapes firm performance, and exploring asset pricing questions when the data gets messy.

I completed my PhD in Finance at the University of Auckland (2025), after a M.MS in Finance (First Class Honors) at the University of Waikato (2021). Along the way I also picked up a PgCert in Computing from ANU (2019) and a B.BA in Finance from Waikato (2018).

On the research side, I have been an affiliated doctoral researcher at Vlerick Business School (2025) and a research assistant at the University of Auckland (2024-2025). On the teaching side, I have worked as a graduate teaching assistant and programming consultant (2022-2025), supporting analytics labs and capstone projects.

Coding-wise, I am most at home in Python and R, and I also use SQL, Stata, and a bit of Java. For dashboards and reporting, I reach for Power BI and Tableau, and I still enjoy a good LaTeX draft when it is time to make things look serious.

I also spent time in industry as a finance project analyst at Oxford Finance (2025), where I reviewed loan closures, recalculated settlement interest, and supported remediation reporting.
